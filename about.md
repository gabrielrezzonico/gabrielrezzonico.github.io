With over 15 years of experience in software engineering and management, I've journeyed through the
ever-evolving landscape of technology. From crafting elegant solutions in Python, C++, and GoLang to
architecting robust applications with TypeScript, React, and Next.js, I've honed my skills across a myriad of
technologies. As both a hands-on developer and a seasoned software manager, I bring a unique perspective to
the table, blending technical expertise with leadership acumen. Join me as we explore the exciting
intersections of code, creativity, and innovation, charting new paths and pushing the boundaries of what's
possible.
